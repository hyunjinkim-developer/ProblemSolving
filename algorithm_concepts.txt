# DFS (Depth-First Search)
	- Use Stack 
## Data structure for Nodes and Edges
- Adjacency Matrix
	- PROS:
		Time efficient for accessing certain edges
	- CONS: 
		The more nodes(with sparse edges) memory loss, because save all possible edges between nodes
- Adjacency List
	- PROS:
		- Memory efficient, save edges that exists
		- Better when traveling every adjacent edges
	- CONS:
		Time inefficient, need more time to check whether certain edge exists, should run every edges

# BFS (Breadth First Search)
	- queue
